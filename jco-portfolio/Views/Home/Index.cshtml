<p>Growing up in the 90s, I made my first website with basic HTML when I was in 6th grade.
    It had a picture of a griffon that I drew, links to several "hot" websites, and a visitor counter. 
    Needless to say, it was majestic. I was also a member of many
    GeoCities communities and made several websites there for online gaming groups I was a part of.
    These experiences gave me an early interest in developing websites and online communities.
    I'm excited to take my development skills to the next level with Epicodus, and to exhibit my past projects
    here 
    in my portfolio.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to look over my portfolio, and as the Klingon say, <strong>'jaj vIghaj'</strong> -- Own the day.</p>
